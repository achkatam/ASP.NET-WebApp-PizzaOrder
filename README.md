# ASP.NET-WebApp-PizzaOrder

Desciption for the simple project:

## Used Razor pages  
### 1. Very basic project. Still experiencing problems with the site.css. 
### 2. Tried to follow MVVM pattern (Model-View ViewModel pattern) to separate the presentation of the page.
### 3. Set up Data Model - could be done by using interfaces for each type of pizza inherited by abstract pizza class.
### 4. IActionResult OnPost and Redirection to another page.
### 5. Mocked Database and set asp-route 
### 6. SQL Database added
### 7. Every new order is saved in the SQL DB
